Hosting an event and looking to sell tickets? Looking to join an event?

Made easy with EVENTI0

# Check it out

Here is a link to hosted version of the website: https://timely-syrniki-5cfacf.netlify.app/

Instructions to local hosting are below. Otherwise, please refer to the (#Test) section to test site. 

# How-To

Setup: if you are cloning this repo, make sure you have Node.js install {v22.13.1 used by me}. If you want to run the app locally, I recommend you open two terminals. 

One: change directory to Event00\mongoDB and run `node server.js`. This will connect you to the database. 

Two: make sure to have all dependencies installed by running `npm install`. You can now run `npm run dev` to host the app locally. 

# Test 

You are able to set up a Staff account, but here are account details you may use:
